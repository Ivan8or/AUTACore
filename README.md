This is the AUTACore GitHub!
AUTACore is a program designed to allow users of the hypixel.net forums to automate their posts!

the java classes:
AUTAction: the class intended to be changed; this is responsible for what your threads do / your custom logic
ForumThread: a representation of a single forum thread; this is where the information from the webpage is parsed and made into a useable form
AUTACore: the main class which creates a virtual browser that logs in to hypixel.net, as well as starts running the thread logic added in the AUTAction class
